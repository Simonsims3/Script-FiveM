# Save Coords

This is a resource I use, when I need mulptiples coords for a script.

## Usage

1. Start the resource `start Save_coords`.
2. Type the command `/savecoords`.
3. Press 'E' to take the coords.
4. Find all the saved coords in the file in ./Coords/xx-xx-xx.txt .

## Disclaimer

Any help to improve it is welcome, but i won't provide any support since this is just made to help me.
